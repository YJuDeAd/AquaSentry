# AquaSentry üåäüõ°Ô∏è

**Status:** üöß In Planning & Development üöß

**AquaSentry** is a project aimed at building an AI-powered surveillance system for **Underwater Domain Awareness**. Our goal is to analyze hydrophone audio data to automatically detect, analyze, and classify acoustic anomalies.

This project is being built for the [House of Turning](https://www.techtatva.club/house-of-turing).

## The Vision

The underwater domain is filled with ambient noise, making it difficult to manually monitor for specific objects of interest (like ships, submarines, or even marine life). Our vision for **AquaSentry** is to create an intelligent system that acts as a vigilant "sentry," listening to the ocean's sounds and alerting users to significant events.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives are to develop a system that can:

1.  **Isolate Anomalies:** Successfully distinguish meaningful signals from the background ambient noise in an audio file.
2.  **Characterize Objects:** Extract a set of unique acoustic features (a "signature") from each detected anomaly.
3.  **Classify Threats:** Build a machine learning model to classify these signatures into predefined categories.

## Proposed Technical Approach

We plan to implement a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Signal Processing:** Load `.wav` files and apply filters to clean the audio. We will establish a baseline for ambient noise.
2.  **Event Detection:** Implement an algorithm to scan the audio and segment out clips where the sound energy surpasses the baseline noise profile.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** For each event, we plan to extract features like MFCCs, spectral contrast, and chroma.
4.  **Classification:** Use the extracted features to train a classifier (e.g., SVM, RandomForest, or a small Neural Network) to identify the object's class.
